( This is a text cell. ) The code cells can be executed in any order, and you can edit an re-execute any cell. It is a very powerful environment for exploratory data analysis/ CoLab is based on Jupyter and skills gained in using CoLab can be easily transfered to Jupyter, although there are some notable differences.\n",

We'll provide other training options to get a solid base in Python, and this notebook will show you what you'll be able to do with the environment.  \n",
